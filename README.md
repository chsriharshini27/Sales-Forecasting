# Sales-Forecasting

Key Concepts in Sales Forecasting

Historical Data: The foundation of sales forecasting, typically including past sales, economic indicators, and other relevant variables.

Time Series Analysis: Techniques for analyzing time-ordered data points. Common methods include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), Exponential Smoothing, and Seasonal Decomposition.

Causal Models: These models consider external factors that might affect sales, such as marketing efforts, economic conditions, and competitor actions.

Machine Learning: Techniques like regression models, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods to predict sales based on complex patterns in the data.

Evaluation Metrics: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.


Steps to Build a Sales Forecasting Model in Python


Data Collection: Gather historical sales data and other relevant variables.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and transforming variables if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data to understand trends, seasonality, and relationships between variables.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate models based on the data characteristics and forecasting horizon.

Model Training: Train the models on historical data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model for making future sales predictions.

Model Maintenance: Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available.


Example Code:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col='date')

# Exploratory Data Analysis
data.plot(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.show()

# Train-test split
train = data.iloc[:-12]
test = data.iloc[-12:]

# Model training
model = SARIMAX(train, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 12))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=False)

# Forecasting
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)
forecast = pd.Series(forecast, index=test.index)

# Plotting the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(train, label='Train')
plt.plot(test, label='Test')
plt.plot(forecast, label='Forecast')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Evaluate the model
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(test, forecast))
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}')
